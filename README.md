## Short Description
Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) are at the very core of many biological processes such as signal transduction, metabolic regulation and enzymatic complexes.

Accurately predicting the strength of such interactions is a problem that has been under investigation for a long time (REF Janin 1975, Lewis 1992) with various approaches. 
Understanding the effect of point mutations on binding affinity could elucidate the targets for drug discovery and disease modeling. 

## Course Aim
* Plan and carry out a biotechnological project with the aim to investigate  the dynamics, interactions and/or structures of biomolecules.
* Critically analyze, value and summarize the  results obtained and present them in writing as well as orally for different target groups.
* Carry out well-founded scientific, social and ethical assessments of all parts of the project.
* Search, evaluate and use the scientific literature in subjects that lie within the scope of the course and implement this knowledge in the framework of the project.

### Project Aim

The aim of this project is to develop machine learning approaches for PPI affinity predicition. 
This is an *open-ended* and *student-driven* project, your interests will influence the outcome and direction of this project. 

### Ingredients for a well structured Project Plan
